She was later resurrected in a Japanese TV show using 3D VR technology in 2017.</p><p>To commemorate the 10th anniversary of her death, the Teresa Teng Culture and Education Foundation launched a campaign entitled "Feel Teresa Teng". In addition to organizing an anniversary concert in Hong Kong and Taiwan, fans paid homage at her shrine at Chin Pao San Cemetery. Additionally, some of her dresses, jewelry and personal items were placed on exhibition at Yuzi Paradise, an art park outside Guilin, China. The foundation also served as her wishes to set up a school or educational institute.</p><p>In 2009, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, a government web portal conducted an online poll to chose "The Most Influential Cultural icon in China since 1949", over 24 million people voted and Teng came out as the winner with 8.5&nbsp;million votes. In 2010, CNN included her among the 20 biggest music icons of the past 50 years alongside Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Rolling Stone.</p><p>In May 2002, a wax figure of Teng was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. A house she bought in 1986 in Hong Kong at No. 18 Carmel Street, Stanley also became a popular fan site soon after her death.

It closed on what would have been her 51st birthday on 29 January 2004.</p><p>In 1998, Paul Quilery revealed that Teng was engaged to him, and was due to get married in August 1995.</p><p>The 1996 Hong Kong film Comrades: Almost a Love Story, directed by <a href=#>Peter Chan</a>, features the tragedy and legacy of Teng in a subplot to the main story. The movie won best picture in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and at the Seattle Film Festival in the United States. In 2007, TV Asahi produced a TV movie entitled Teresa Teng Monogatari (テレサ・テン物語 ) to commemorate the 13th anniversary of her death. Actress <a href=#>Yoshino Kimura</a> starred as Teng.</p><p>Teng died from a severe respiratory attack while on vacation in Thailand in 1995, at the age of 42. She remains a national heroine and a cultural symbol of Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and other ethnic Chinese communities worldwide.</p><p>Teng died from a severe asthma attack, though doctors and her partner Paul Quilery had speculated that she died from a heart attack due to a side effect of an overdose of unspecified amphetamines while on holiday in Chiang Mai, Thailand at the age of 42 on 8 May 1995. Quilery was buying groceries when the attack occurred. He was also aware that Teng relied on the same medication in the two months before her death with minor attacks. Teng had asthma throughout her adult life.</p><p>In 1995, a tribute album called "A Tribute to Teresa Teng" was released, which contained covers of Teng's songs by prominent Chinese rock bands.</p><p>Though Teng performed in many countries around the world, she never performed in mainland China. The CPC eventually invited her to do so in the 1990s, but she died before she was able to do so.</p><p>Teng performed in Paris during the 1989 Tiananmen student protests on behalf of the students and expressed her support. On 27 May 1989, over 300,000 people attended the concert called "Democratic songs dedicated to China" (民主歌聲獻中華 ) at the Happy Valley Racecourse in Hong Kong. One of the highlights was her rendition of "My Home Is on the Other Side of the Mountain."</p><p>Teng's contract with Polydor ended in 1981, and she signed a contract with Taurus Records in 1983 and made a successful comeback appearance in Japan. In 1983, Taurus released her album, Dandan youqing, which consisted of settings of 12 poems from the Tang and Song dynasties. The music, written by composers of her earlier hits, blended modern and traditional Oriental and Occidental styles. The most popular single from the album is "Wishing We Last Forever". The number of hits released in the years from 1984 to 1989 make them "Teresa Teng's Golden Years" to many of her fans. During this time, she won the All-Japan Record Awards for four consecutive years (1984–1988). Teng was also named one of the Top 7 diva wonders of the world by TIME magazine.</p><p>In the early 1980s, continuing political tension between mainland China and Taiwan led to her music, along with that of other singers from Taiwan and Hong Kong, being banned for several years in mainland China for being too "bourgeois". Her popularity in mainland China continued to grow nonetheless thanks to its black market. As Teng songs continued to be played everywhere, from nightclubs to government buildings, the ban on her music was soon lifted. Her fans nicknamed her "Little Deng" because she had the same family name as Deng Xiaoping; there was a saying that "Deng the leader ruled by day, but Deng the singer ruled by night.</p><p>During the 1980s, Filipina entertainers in Japan loved her songs so much, they covered her music in karaoke bars.</p><p>In 1978, Teng met Beau Kuok, a Malaysian businessman and son of multi-billionaire Robert Kuok. They were engaged in 1982, but Teng called off the engagement due to prenuptial agreements which stipulated that she had to quit and sever all ties with the entertainment industry, as well as fully disclose her biography and all her past relationships in writing.</p><p>In 1974 the song "Airport" (空港 , Kūkō) , which was covered in Mandarin as "Lover's Care" (情人的關懷 ) in 1976, became a hit in Japan. Teng's popularity there continued despite being briefly barred from the country in 1979 for having a fake Indonesian passport she purchased for US$20,000. The subterfuge had seemed necessary due to the official break in relations between Republic of China and Japan that occurred shortly after the People's Republic of China replaced the ROC in the United Nations.</p><p>Her popularity boomed in the 1970s after her success in Japan. By now singing in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and English, Teng's influence spread to Malaysia and Indonesia. In Taiwan, she was known not only as the island's most popular export, but as "the soldier's sweetheart" because of her frequent performances for servicemen. Teng was herself the child of a military family. Her concerts for troops featured Taiwanese folk songs that appealed to natives of the island as well as Chinese folk songs that appealed to homesick refugees of the civil war.</p><p>Until the late 1970s, foreign music was not allowed into mainland China and love songs were virtually unknown. Teng's popular romantic song "The Moon Represents My Heart," released in 1978, became one of the first foreign songs to break into the country. Teng's songs over the following decade further revolutionized Chinese music scene.. Her songs have been covered by a number of famous singers, including Faye Wong, who released a tribute album (Decadent Sound of Faye, 菲靡靡之音 , 1995) of Teng's popular hits. In 2017, popular American rockstar Jon Bon Jovi covered one of Teng's biggest Hits,"The Moon Represents My Heart" for Valentine's Day. Her songs are featured in various films, such as Rush Hour 2, The Game, Prison On Fire, Formosa Betrayed, Gomorrah, and Crazy Rich Asians. In 1980, Teng became the first singer of Chinese ethnicity to perform at the Lincoln Centre in New York City in the United States, one of the most famous musical venues in US.</p><p>Teng gained her first taste of fame in 1968 when a performance on a popular Taiwanese music program led to a record contract. She released several albums within the next few years under the Life Records label. In 1973 she attempted to crack the Japanese market by signing with the Polydor Japan label and taking part in the country's Kōhaku Uta Gassen, an annual singing competition of the most successful artists: She was named "Best New Singing Star". Following her success in Japan, Teng recorded several Japanese songs, including original hits such as "Give yourself to the flow of Time" (時の流れに身をまかせ , Toki no Nagare ni Mi wo Makase) which was later covered in Mandarin as "I Only Care About You".</p><p>As a young child, Teng won awards for her singing at talent competitions. Her first major prize was in 1964 when she sang "Visiting Yingtai" from Shaw Brothers' Huangmei opera movie, The Love Eterne, at an event hosted by Broadcasting Corporation of China. She was soon able to support her family with her singing. Taiwan's rising manufacturing economy in the 1960s made the purchase of records easier for more families. With her father's approval, she quit school to pursue singing professionally.</p><p>Teresa Teng (traditional Chinese: 鄧麗君 ; simplified Chinese: 邓丽君 ; pinyin: Dèng Lìjūn ; Jyutping: Dang6 Lai6-gwan1 , 29 January 1953 – 8 May 1995) was a Chinese singer and a cultural icon from Taiwan, widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential singers in Asian recording history.
