Parnell voices Cyril Figgis on "Archer" (2009â€“present) and Jerry Smith on "Rick and Morty" (2013â€“present), and he has also lent his voice to the films "Escape from Planet Earth" (2013), "Hotel Transylvania 2" (2015), and "Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation" (2018) and the TV shows "WordGirl" (2007â€“2015), "Electric City" (2012), "Nature Cat" (2015â€“2020), "Dawn of the Croods" (2015â€“2016), "The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show" (2015â€“2017), "Elena of Avalor" (2016â€“present), "American Dad!" (2016â€“present), and "Family Guy" (2019â€“2021).</p><p>Chris is also known for starring in the "Lazy Sunday" video with <a href=# title="Andy Samberg Net Worth">Andy Samberg</a>; the video went viral after airing on "SNL" in December 2005 and was named one of the "videos that changed YouTube forever" by "Business Insider" in 2020.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Chris Parnell was born Thomas Christopher Parnell in February 5, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee. He grew up in a Southern Baptist household with father Jack (a radio personally) and mother Shirley. In a 2015 Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything), Chris was asked about his heritage, and he responded, "My heritage I don't know, because I'm adopted, but based on information that the adoption agency got from my birth parents, they seem to think I was Irish, English and German." Parnell attended the Southern Baptist Educational Center and Germantown High School, and when he was 17, he decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a stage actor. After graduation, he enrolled at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he earned a BFA in Drama. Chris then moved to Houston, Texas, and joined an apprentice actor program at the Alley Theatre. He was not asked to join the theatre company after his apprenticeship, so he returned to Memphis and spent a year teaching at Germantown High School. In 1992, Parnell moved to Los Angeles and began taking classes at the Groundlings.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>While he was a&nbsp;company player with the Groundlings, Chris started acting in commercials and landing guest roles on TV shows such as "Hope & Gloria" (1996), "Seinfeld" (1997), and "The <a href=# title="Jamie Foxx Net Worth">Jamie Foxx</a> Show" (1997). He made his big screen debut in 1996's "Jingle All the Way," and in 1998, he was hired as a featured player on "Saturday Night Live." He was promoted to a full cast member the following season, and in 2001, he was fired due to budget cuts, but his absence didn't last long. As Parnell joked in a November 2002 "SNL" rap, "Lorne liked me so much he hired me twice." In September 2006, after appearing in more than 140 episodes of the show, Chris was the victim of budget cuts once again, but he quickly found a new role, thanks to his former "SNL" castmate <a href=# title="Tina Fey Net Worth">Tina Fey</a>: Dr. Leo Spaceman on "30 Rock." Quite possibly the world's worst (but most entertaining) doctor, Dr. Spaceman was featured in 24 episodes of the series and was reportedly "sort of loosely based on <a href=# title="Lorne Michaels Net Worth">Lorne Michaels</a>' real life doctor."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-248418 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GettyImages-540629448.jpg alt="Chris Parnell Net Worth" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-248418 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>Parnell appeared in the 2000 "SNL" spin-off movie "The Ladies Man," then he co-starred with fellow University of North Carolina School of the Arts alum <a href=# title="Diedrich Bader Net Worth">Diedrich Bader</a> in 2003's "Evil Alien Conquerors."
