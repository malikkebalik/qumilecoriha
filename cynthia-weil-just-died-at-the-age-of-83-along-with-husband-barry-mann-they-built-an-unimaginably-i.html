These writer/producers include Pharrell, Sia, <a href=# title="Ryan Tedder Net Worth">Ryan Tedder</a>, Dr. Luke, <a title="One Man Has Written Virtually Every Major Pop Song Of The Last 20 Years.

If they touch your track, it's sure to be a hit. However, all of that musical prowess is arguably eclipsed by one songwriting duo that churned out hit tracks for over five decades. That songwriting duo is Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. And not are they business and artistic partners, Barry and Cynthia were also husband and wife from 1961 until her death in June 2023.</p><p class=p1>While Mann and Weil may not have penned the latest hit for <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth">Miley Cyrus</a>, they did manage to remain relevant, award-winning, and wealthy for decades in an industry that regularly eats up and spits out artists.

To date, over <strong>200 million copies</strong> of their tracks have been sold.

After completing school, they began their&nbsp;careers.</p><p>She became an actress and dancer and&nbsp;he pursued a career as a vocalist. Both showed major talent as songwriters, however, and various mentors and colleagues steered each of them&nbsp;towards careers operating behind the scenes.</p><p>In the late 50s, they were both hired to pen tracks for other artists by the prestigious Aldon Music, a successful music company run by <a href=# title="Don Kirshner Net Worth">Don Kirshner</a> and Al Nevin. As staff songwriters, their job was to write hit songs for everyone. Mann first achieved some success working with other writers. He penned such tracks as "She Say (Oom Dooby Doom)," for The Diamonds in 1959, which reached the Top 20 on the charts, and co-wrote "I Love How You Love Me" for The Paris Sisters, which went on to climb to #5. He even scored his own hit single with the track "Who Put the Bomp." It wasn't until he teamed up with Cynthia Weil, however, that the hits began coming in, rapid fire.</p><h2><strong>1960s: Massive Success</strong></h2><p class=p1>Cynthia Weil was primarily a lyricist, and had gained a reputation for writing meaningful lyrics during a time when doo-wop and nonsense lyrics were the popular norm. Combined with Mann's musical ability, the duo quickly began making a name for themselves.</p><p class=p1>At the time, Aldon Music, which was housed in the Brill Building in Manhattan, was the epicenter of the Sixties sound. The office was a warren of small, windowless cubicles. Each little room contained only a desk and a piano. Somehow, amidst the chaos, songwriting duos like&nbsp;<strong>Carol King and Gerry Goffin, <a href=# title="Neil Sedaka Net Worth">Neil Sedaka</a> and Howard Greenfield, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller–</strong>along with Mann and Weil–churned out hit after hit.</p><p class=p1>The pair began writing together in 1960, and were married a year later. All day, every day, they wrote an ever expanding catalogue of socially conscious rock, pop, country, and Broadway songs that are now widely considered to be some of the best songs to come out of the sixties. They wrote over 70 songs as a duo. Of those songs, 63 have charted in the Top 100, 24 in the Top 10, and two tracks have gone to #1.</p><p class=p1>"<strong>You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',</strong>" arguably their most famous song, is the most-played track of the 20th century. It has been featured in countless movies, notably "Top Gun," and has been covered by more than 2,000 artists.</p><p class=p1>Barry and Cynthia also hundreds of tracks separately, working alone and with other writing partners. Mann wrote or co-wrote over 635 tracks, 98 of which have charted in the US. Weil wrote or co-wrote hit songs for such artists as <strong>Lionel Ritchie, <a href=# title="Chaka Khan Net Worth">Chaka Khan</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=# title="Martina McBride Net Worth">Martina McBride</a></strong>, as well as serving as an album supervisor for numerous artists.</p><h2><strong>Accolades</strong></h2><p class=p1>As a duo, they were inducted into the Songwriting Hall of Fame in 1987. They were also awarded the prestigious Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriter's Hall of Fame in 2011. They were honored with the Ahmet Ertegun Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.</p><p class=p1>They received two Grammy Awards in 1988, "Song of the Year" and "Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television" for their track, "<strong>Somewhere Out There,</strong>" performed by <strong><a href=# title="Linda Ronstadt Net Worth">Linda Ronstadt</a> and James Ingram</strong>, written for the film "An American Tail." They have also been nominated for Golden Globes, Oscars, and a host of other awards.</p><p class=p1>Here is a just a short list of some of their many famous tracks:</p><ul><li>"Uptown" performed by The Crystals</li><li>"My Dad" performed by Paul Petersen</li><li>"On Broadway" performed by The Drifters</li><li>"I'm Gonna Be Strong," originally performed by Frankie Laine (Went on to be a Top 10 in the US, performed by Gene Pitney, and a Top 30 hit in the UK, performed by <a href=# title="Cyndi Lauper Net Worth">Cyndi Lauper</a>)</li><li>"Walking in the Rain" performed by The Ronettes</li><li>"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" performed by The Righteous Brothers</li><li>"We Gotta Get Out of This Place" performed by The Animals</li><li>"Here You Come Again" performed by <a href=# title="Dolly Parton Net Worth">Dolly Parton</a></li><li>"Kicks" performed by Paul Revere & the Raiders</li><li>"Shape of Things to Come" performed by Max Frost and the Troopers</li><li>"I Just Can't Help Believing" originally performed by <a href=# title="Bobby Vee net Worth">Bobby Vee</a> (Went to the Top 10 in the US performed by <a href=# title="BJ Thomas Net Worth">B.J.
