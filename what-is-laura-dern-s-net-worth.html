Her parents were Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, both popular actors. Although her parents divorced when she was only two years old, young Dern was raised around movie sets and developed an interest in the dramatic arts from a very early age. When she was only six years old, she appeared in White Lightning, a film starring her mother, Diane Ladd. With her sights firmly set on acting, Dern appeared in several more films throughout the next several years. She was legally emancipated from her parents when she was thirteen, in order to be able to receive a wider range of roles.</p><h2>Laura Dern’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_59>In the mid-80s and early ’90s, Laura Dern became a familiar face in Hollywood. She co-starred with her mother in the critically acclaimed film Rambling Rose&nbsp;and received great praise for her work in movies like Blue Velvet, Mask, and Wild at Heart. She <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>auditioned</a> for the role that ultimately went to Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs.</p><p id=par-4_77>Without a doubt, one of her biggest films was the 1993 blockbuster, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jurassic Park</a>. Dern played paleobotanist Ellie Sattler, a role which she later reprised in Jurassic Park III. Rumors continue to linger about whether or not Dern might appear in yet another Jurassic Park film – but Dern has neither <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>confirmed nor denied</a> the reports. Some of Dern’s other hits include I Am Sam, Happy Endings, Recount, The Master, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a>, and Wild.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_70>Dern prefers to work in many different genres, and as she admitted in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>recent interview</a>, she feels ready to tackle just about any type of role or project that she finds interesting. This bravery has allowed Dern to not only succeed in a difficult industry but also build an impressive portfolio as well as a large bank account – her net worth is reported to be around <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>$20 million</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Laura Dern stars in ‘Big Little Lies’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_57>At the age of 52, when many actresses find themselves typecast into more traditional, less exciting roles, Dern has continued to expand her resume. Her hit HBO show, Big Little Lies, was a runaway hit when it premiered in 2017, and fan reaction was so positive that the show was renewed for a second season in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_48>Dern co-stars opposite a cast that includes Nicole Kidman, Shailene Woodley, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep. The drama tells the tale of a group of emotionally disturbed women who live and work on the California coast. The show has been critically acclaimed and has won several major awards.&nbsp;</p><h2>What’s next for Laura Dern?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_90>Dern is currently starring in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Little Lies</a>&nbsp;but has several film projects in the works as well. She will be appearing in an upcoming Noah Baumbach film, release date not yet set, as well as appearing in the highly anticipated remake of Louisa May Alcott’s classic story, Little Women. Dern has long since proven that she has the talent and the tenacity to take on any role and make it her own – it will be exciting to see what the coming years hold in store for this well-respected actress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMpaCtrJyaeq21xKxksKCRqXqqv4ylmK6qkWKxpr7NrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FloaydoXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./3-songs-stevie-nicks-wrote-about-mick-fleetwood.html>&#171;&nbsp;3 Songs Stevie Nicks Wrote About Mick Fleetwood</a>
