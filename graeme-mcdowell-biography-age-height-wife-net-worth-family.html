The victory marked his first title on the European Tour since 2014 and also improved his world ranking from 104 to 47.</p><p>After the match he admitted that the better player won and that he played poorly, shooting five over for the round. Previously in the knockout stages, McDowell had beaten <a href=#>Richard Finch</a> 3&2, Sergio García on the 19th hole and Rafael Cabrera-Bello 2 up.</p><p>On 31 March 2019, McDowell won his fourth PGA Tour title at the Corales Puntacana Resort and Club Championship in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>On 9 June 2019, McDowell finished tied for 8th at the RBC Canadian Open and therefore qualified for the 2019 Open Championship, which was played at his home course Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland.</p><p>When quizzed on whether he'd represent Britain or Ireland at future Olympic events, McDowell stated: "I’m not bothered who I play for. I’ll be honoured to represent Britain or Ireland or both. I’m proud to play golf for Europe." On the subject of his nationality, he added: "Yes, I sit on the fence but why not? There’s no right or wrong answer. I’m always going to upset someone, so why not sit on the fence?" In the run up to the 2016 Olympics, when golf was reintroduced, <a href=#>Rory McIlroy</a> (representing Ireland) withdrew from the tournament, leaving McDowell with the possibility of representing Ireland as their next highest ranked player. However, McDowell ruled this possibility out by opting out of the Olympics. He often travels and practises with <a href=#>Rory McIlroy</a> and Pádraig Harrington.</p><p>European Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjørn named McDowell as a vice-captain for the European team at the 2018 Ryder Cup. In September 2018, Europe defeated the U.S. team 17½ points to 10½ at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.</p><p>He was tied for the lead going into the final day with Jim Furyk, both playing in the final group on Sunday. The second time in three years that McDowell had featured in the final group of the U.S. Open. Despite a disappointing front nine, where he found himself four over, he made several birdies on the back nine, including one on the 17th hole to trail by one shot with one hole to play.</p><p>In the 2017–18 PGA Tour season, McDowell struggled again and only won $581,024 and finished 144th in the FedEx Cup. This left him with limited status on the PGA Tour for the 2018–19 season.</p><p>In the 2016–17 PGA Tour season, McDowell only had 4 top 10 finishes and finished 136th in the FedEx Cup.</p><p>McDowell endured one of his worst years as a professional during the 2015 season. In fifteen events on the PGA Tour, McDowell made only eight cuts, with just one top five finish, coming in his first tournament of the year.</p><p>In this tournament, the WGC-HSBC Champions, he held the 18, 36 and 54 hole leads and began Sunday with a one stroke lead. He shot a final round of 73 and missed a birdie putt on the final hole, which would have earned him a place in the playoff. He finished the 2015 season at 160th in the FedEx Cup standings and was the first time he had missed out on qualifying for the playoffs since 2010.</p><p>In November 2015, McDowell won his third PGA Tour title at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba. He prevailed in a sudden death playoff over <a href=#>Jason Bohn</a> and <a href=#>Russell Knox</a> during a Monday finish to the tournament. He won with a birdie on the first extra hole after his five iron approach grazed the edge of the cup and left him with three-foot birdie putt. Knox then could only up and down for par, whilst Bohn missed an 18-foot birdie putt to extend the playoff. McDowell said afterwards that the win came at the end of a real grind in what was one of his worst calendar years as a professional.</p><p>In the 2015–16 PGA Tour season, McDowell won $2,596,170 and finished 27th in the season-long FedEx Cup race.</p><p>On Monday, 4 October 2010, McDowell was charged with putting to win on the 17th green of the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor. His was the last match of the 12 player singles, with his opponent being <a href=#>Hunter Mahan</a>, to win the tournament 14.5/13.5 for Europe, and it was his 5-foot putt that was conceded to give victory to Europe.</p><p>In 2014, McDowell continued to play on both the European Tour and PGA Tour. In the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship he made comebacks including winning the 18th in each of his first 3 matches before losing to eventual runner up <a href=#>Victor Dubuisson</a> in the quarter finals.</p><p>McDowell qualified to represent Europe at the 2014 Ryder Cup narrowly edging <a href=#>Stephen Gallacher</a> for the final place based on Official World Golf Ranking points.</p><p>McDowell subsequently competed in the Race to Dubai Final Series events on the European Tour including a tie for third in the HSBC Champions. McDowell finished 14th in the Race to Dubai rankings on the European Tour in 2014.</p><p>The win moved him into 8th in the world rankings. In the 2013 Volvo World Match Play Championship, he defeated <a href=#>Thongchai Jaidee</a>, 2 & 1, to win. The win moved him to the top of the Race to Dubai and 7th in the world. He missed the cut in the European Tour's flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship. In the 2013 U.S. Open he missed the cut; the event he had won in 2010. This was the first time that he had ever missed the cut in that event. In July 2013, he won the Alstom Open de France, shooting a final round of 67 to finish four shots ahead of <a href=#>Richard Sterne</a>.</p><p>In his next event, Alstom Open de France, he recorded his only win of the season, defending the title he won in 2013 despite going into the final round 8 shots behind <a href=#>Kevin Stadler</a>.</p><p>In March 2012, McDowell recorded his joint best finish on the PGA Tour outside of his U.S. Open win, when he finished as runner-up, five strokes behind Tiger Woods at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. This was the second time McDowell had been a runner-up on the PGA Tour. Two weeks later, McDowell had his best performance at The Masters, when he finished in a tie for 12th. He shot a final round of 68 to jump up inside the top 15.</p><p>McDowell was runner up in May 2012 at the Volvo World Match Play Championship at the Finca Cortesin Golf Club, losing the final 1 down to Belgium's <a href=#>Nicolas Colsaerts</a>. In a tight match, McDowell was never more than 2 down but was never in front in the match either.</p><p>In June 2012, the U.S. Open returned to California, when it was held at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, less than 100 miles from Pebble Beach, the site of McDowell's 2010 U.S. Open victory. Again he was in contention after rounds of 69-72-68 on the first three days had positioned him at one under for the championship.</p><p>The following month, at the 2012 Open Championship at Royal Lytham & St Annes, McDowell was in contention on Sunday for the second consecutive major. He had shot rounds of 67-69-67 during the first three days to be at seven under par and trail leader Adam Scott by four strokes in second place with <a href=#>Brandt Snedeker</a>. McDowell played in the final group on Sunday for the second consecutive major championship and third time overall, alongside Scott. He had a disappointing round of 75 (+5) and was never in contention for the championship all afternoon. His challenge was ended at the par five 11th, when he snap hooked his second shot into the trees left and had to take a penalty drop, costing him a bogey. He finished the championship in a tie for 5th with fellow European <a href=#>Luke Donald</a>. It was however his best ever placing at The Open Championship. In December, he won the World Challenge, beating <a href=#>Keegan Bradley</a> by three shots.</p><p>McDowell has won eleven events on the European Tour, and four on the PGA Tour. He has also represented Ireland at the World Cup and he has been a member of the European Ryder Cup team on four occasions. He has appeared in the top-10 in the Official World Golf Ranking and his best ranking position was 4th (January to March 2011).</p><p>McDowell had a solid but unspectacular season in 2011 where he did not record a win on either of the main tours. He finished third on four occasions, three on the European Tour and once on the PGA Tour. McDowell finished the year 16th on the European Tour's Race to Dubai, his year consisting of 17 out of 18 cuts made and five top-10 finishes.</p><p>In May 2011, McDowell was in contention to win the PGA Tour's flagship event, The Players Championship, but shot a final round 79 to end his chances. He earned over a million dollars on the PGA Tour but could only finish the year 73rd in the FedEx Cup standings.</p><p>He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to golf.</p><p>In January 2011 McDowell was photographed by <a href=#>Kevin Abosch</a> for "The Face of Ireland" project.</p><p>McDowell is a devoted Manchester United fan. In the buildup to the 2011 Masters Tournament he skipped the annual par-3 contest in order to watch a UEFA Champions League clash between United and Chelsea.</p><p>In June 2011, McDowell received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc) from the University of Ulster for his services to golf. He received his honorary degree from the University's Chancellor, the actor James Nesbitt on its Coleraine campus and in his speech to graduates, urged them to set their goals high in their careers and trust their intuition.</p><p>In June 2010, McDowell won the Celtic Manor Wales Open by three shots. This was his fifth European win.</p><p>In June 2010, McDowell won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, becoming the first Northern Irishman to accomplish the feat, and the first European U.S. Open winner since <a href=#>Tony Jacklin</a> in 1970.</p><p>McDowell embraced his father, Kenny, on Father's Day, and almost immediately called fellow golfer <a href=#>Rory McIlroy</a> to joke about a possible partnership in the 2010 Ryder Cup. He celebrated with a large crowd, including fellow golfer Pádraig Harrington, in the United States.</p><p>He finished the 2010 season with another win at the Andalucía Valderrama Masters and was second behind <a href=#>Martin Kaymer</a> in the 2010 Race to Dubai standings.</p><p>On 5 December 2010, McDowell beat Tiger Woods in a playoff to win the 2010 Chevron World Challenge.</p><p>McDowell and Kaymer shared the European Tour Golfer of the Year award. At the end of 2010, McDowell was ranked 6th in the world.</p><p>McDowell played in The Honda Classic the week after and recorded his second consecutive top-10 with a T-9 finish. The next week he played in the final group with Tiger Woods in the WGC-Cadillac Championship and finished in a T-3 position. He missed the cut in the Masters Tournament by one stroke, bogeying the last hole. The next week he played the RBC Heritage. In the final round in stormy weather, he posted a two-under-par 69. He entered a playoff with fellow U.S. Open champion <a href=#>Webb Simpson</a>. Simpson bogeyed the first hole and McDowell parred to win his first regular PGA Tour event and his first tour win since 2010.</p><p>McDowell comes from a mixed Catholic/Protestant family background, but was himself raised a Protestant. As he won the U.S. Open in 2010 he was living in a "bachelor pad" penthouse apartment in Portrush and was building a home in Lake Nona, Florida, United States. McDowell hired interior designer Kristin Stape to work on his Lake Nona house: subsequently the pair began dating, and were engaged in October 2012. The couple married in a small ceremony in the Bahamas in September 2013. Kristin gave birth to the couple's first child, a girl, in August 2014. She has a child from a previous relationship.</p><p>WD = Withdrew QF, R16, R32, R64 = Round in which player lost in match play NT = no tournament "T" = tied Note that the HSBC Champions did not become a WGC event until 2009.</p><p>In 2008 he returned to the winner's enclosure by winning first the Ballantine's Championship in South Korea, and then the Barclays Scottish Open. He played in the 2008 Ryder Cup, earning 2.5 points for the European team and finished the season ranked fifth on the Order of Merit.</p><p>McDowell managed two top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour, including a tie for second place at the Bay Hill Invitational, which enabled him to earn enough money to become fully exempt on the PGA Tour in 2006. He failed, however, to finish in the top-150 in the 2006 PGA Tour money list, and decided to return to the European Tour for 2007.</p><p>That win led to McDowell being given honorary life membership at the Royal Portrush Golf Club. He did not win in his second season, but in 2004 he claimed the Telecom Italia Open and finished sixth on the European Tour's Order of Merit. In 2005, he divided his time between the European and U.S. PGA Tours.</p><p>In his teens he attended Coleraine Academical Institution. He then studied engineering at Queen's University in Belfast, then transferred to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he played college golf through the spring of 2002.</p><p>As a senior with the Blazers in 2002, McDowell won six of twelve college events and the Haskins Award, given to the outstanding collegiate golfer in the United States. He was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland team which retained the Walker Cup in 2001 at Sea Island, Georgia.</p><p>McDowell turned professional in 2002 and won that season's Volvo Scandinavian Masters, which was only his fourth start on the European Tour.</p><p>He was also the first player from the United Kingdom to win a major championship since <a href=#>Paul Lawrie</a> won The Open Championship in 1999, and the first Northern Irishman to win a major since Fred Daly won the 1947 Open Championship.</p><p>Graeme McDowell MBE (born 30 July 1979) is a professional golfer from Northern Ireland who plays on both the PGA Tour and European Tour. He is well known for winning the 2010 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach, where he ended a 40-year drought for Europeans at the tournament.</p><p>At the PGA Championship, McDowell made the cut finishing in a tie of 46th, subsequently competing in the FedEx Cup Playoffs, however he failed to progress to the year end Tour Championship finishing outside the top-30 in 56th place.</p><p>McDowell was only the second European to win the U.S. Open since 1925. He rose to number 13 in the world rankings, then a career high, and became the eighth European in the top 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnL%2BiscyeZKablKTEprjL</p></div><div id=links><a href=./grant-hill-net-worth-endorsement-investment.html>&#171;&nbsp;Grant Hill Net Worth: Endorsement &amp;amp; Investment</a>
