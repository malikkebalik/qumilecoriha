Those earnings were produced thanks largely to a grueling tour schedule that saw the group perform 93 shows in a 12 month period. They are one of the most popular streaming acts on the planet with 4 billion streams in the same time period. Between September 2018 and September 2019, they earned $36 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Takeoff was born as Kirshnik Khari Ball on June 18, 1994 in Lawrenceville, Georgia, a town near Atlanta.

Remixed by Canadian rapper <a href=# title="Drake Net Worth">Drake</a>, it peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100, and hit number 31 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The single was then featured on Migos' mixtape "Y.R.N." The group subsequently released "No Label 2," a sequel to its second mixtape that was downloaded over 100,000 times during its first week of release. More success came in 2014 with the single "Fright Night," which peaked at number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>In 2015, Migos released its debut studio album, "Yung Rich Nation."

Also in 2015, Migos partnered with Rich the Kid for the album "Streets on Lock 4."</p><h2 id=continued-success-with-migos><strong>Continued Success with Migos</strong></h2><p>Migos had its first number-one hit with 2016's "Bad and Boujee," featuring <a href=# title="Lil Uzi Vert Net Worth">Lil Uzi Vert</a>; it was the first single from the group's second album, "Culture." The song went on to become certified four times platinum by the RIAA. However, Takeoff was not featured nor credited on the track, on account of him having been busy during its recording. "Culture" was ultimately released in January of 2017, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 and moving around 131,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. That July, it went platinum.</p><p>Toward the end of 2017, Migos released "MotorSport," the lead single from its third studio album, "Culture II." Featuring Trinidadian-American rappers <a href=# title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=# title="Cardi B Net Worth">Cardi B</a>, the song hit number six on the Billboard Hot 100.

However, the group ran into trouble early, taking to the stage almost an hour-and-a-half later than the scheduled set time. Moreover, Migos performed for less than 30 minutes, violating the contract's stipulation of a 45-minute set length. When the scent of marijuana was detected coming from the group's vehicles, law enforcement went in to investigate and they ended up arresting the trio and 12 members of the entourage on account of controlled substance possession, as well as possession of firearms within a school safety zone and possession of firearms by convicted felons, the latter charge due to Offset's prior criminal record and incarceration.</p><p>Two days after the incident, Takeoff, Quavo, and six members of their entourage were released on bond. Offset and the six others remained in custody without bond.</p><h2 id=other-legal-troubles><strong>Other Legal Troubles</strong></h2><p>In July of 2017, Takeoff ran into more trouble prior to takeoff on a flight from Atlanta to Des Moines, Iowa. After he allegedly refused to move his bag from the floor to the overhead storage, he was asked to be removed from the plane.</p><p>Further controversy came in 2020, when Takeoff was named as the perpetrator in a civil lawsuit that charged him with sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, and more. The lawsuit was filed by a female victim, who cited Takeoff for these abuses at a house party in Los Angeles. In 2021, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office announced that it would not be filing any criminal charges against Takeoff due to inadequate supporting evidence.</p><h2 id=death><strong>Death</strong></h2><p>In the early morning hours of November 1, 2022 Takeoff was shot while attending a private party in Houston. He was 28 years old. In May 2023, Patrick Xavier Clark was indicted by a grand jury for the murder. If convicted, he'll face between 5 years and life in prison. In June 2023, Takeoff's mother filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the bowling alley where her son was shot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6murLHOn51mppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./andy-hug-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>&#171;&nbsp;Andy Hug Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a>
