Run Net Worth?</strong></h2><p>Joseph Simmons is an American rapper, DJ, and producer who has a net worth of $60 million dollars. Simmons became a household name in the 1980s as a founding member of the hip-hop group Run-D.M.C., the first hip-hop group to have a Gold album (1984's "Runâ€“D.M.C.") and a Platinum record (1985's "King of Rock"). Simmons began using the name "Rev. Run" after being ordained as a Pentecostal minister, and he found success on television as the star of the MTV reality series "Run's House" from 2005 to 2009. In 2008, he released the book "Take Back Your Family: A Challenge to America's Parents," which he co-wrote with his wife, Justine.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Joseph Simmons was born Joseph Ward Simmons on November 14, 1964, in Queens, New York. His mother, Evelyn, worked as a park administrator for the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, and his father, Daniel, taught black history and worked as a school attendance supervisor. Joseph's older brothers are artist Danny Simmons and Def Jam records co-founder <a href=#>Russell Simmons</a>.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Before he co-founded Run-D.M.C. with <a href=# title="Darryl McDaniels Net Worth">Darryl McDaniels</a> ("D.M.C") and Jason Mizell ("<a href=# title="Jam Master Jay Net Worth">Jam Master Jay</a>"), Simmons was in a hip-hop group called The Force. Run-D.M.C. signed a deal with Profile Records and released the single "It's Like That/Sucker MCs" in 1983, followed by their self-titled debut album on March 27, 1984. "Run-D.M.C." peaked at #14 on the "Billboard" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and the group's next album, 1985's "King of Rock," reached #12. Run-D.M.C. then released the 3x Platinum "Raising Hell" (1986), which hit #1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #3 on the "Billboard" 200 chart; the album also earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Performance By a Duo Or Group with Vocal. The group followed their multi-platinum album with "Tougher Than Leather" (1988), "Back from Hell" (1990), "Down with the King" (1993), and "Crown Royal" (2001). Mizell was murdered in 2002, leading to the disbanding of Run-D.M.C.</p><p>During Run-D.M.C.'s nearly 20-year career, the group released several popular singles, including "Christmas in Hollis" (1987), "Run's House" (1988), and "Down with the King" (1993), and their 1986 cover of Aerosmith's "Walk This Way" went Platinum and reached #4 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. The group achieved many firsts in the hip-hop genre, becoming the first act to grace the cover of "Rolling Stone" magazine and have music videos air on MTV, and their album "Raising Hell" was the genre's first multi-platinum record. The album was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2018, an honor reserved for recordings that are considered to be "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant." Run-D.M.C. came in at #48 on "Rolling Stone's" 100 Greatest Artists of All Time list in 2004, and MTV and VH1 both named them the greatest hip-hop group/artist of all time in 2007.</p><p>In 2005, Simmons released a solo album, "Distortion," and his single "Mind on the Road" can be heard in the video game "Madden NFL 06." That year, he was also featured on the single "Song 4 Lovers" by Liberty X, a pop band from the U.K. Joseph competed on the game show "The Weakest Link" in 2002 and was voted off third; this "Rap Stars" episode also featured <a href=# title="Jermaine Dupri Net Worth">Jermaine Dupri</a>, <a href=# title="Nate Dogg Net Worth">Nate Dogg</a>, and <a href=# title="Xzibit Net Worth">Xzibit</a>. In 2005, the Simmons family began appearing on the reality show "Run's House," which aired 59 episodes over six seasons. Joseph later starred in and produced "Rev Run's Renovation" (2014-2015), which aired on HGTV and the DIY Network, the Cooking Channel's "Rev Run's Sunday Suppers" (2014-2016), and the Travel Channel's "Rev Runs Around the World" (2015-2016). He has more than 30 acting credits to his name and has guest-starred on shows such as Fox's "Grounded for Life" (2002), NBC's "Great News" (2017), and TBS' <a href=# title="Tracy Morgan Net Worth">Tracy Morgan</a> comedy "The Last O.G." (2019). Simmons was the star of Netflix's "All About the Washingtons" (2018), which co-starred his wife and ran for 10 episodes, and he served as a producer on that show as well as "Daddy's Girls" (2009), an MTV reality show that starred his oldest daughters, <a href=#>Vanessa Simmons</a> and <a href=#>Angela Simmons</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308749 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/run.jpg alt width=816 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308749 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Joseph and Valerie Vaughn married in 1983, and they had son Joseph Jr. ("JoJo") and daughters Vanessa and Angela together before divorcing in 1992. Simmons went on to marry Justine Jones in June 1994, and they welcomed sons Daniel ("Diggy") and Russell ("Russy") and daughter Victoria together. Sadly, Victoria passed away shortly after her birth in 2006 due to a birth defect called omphalocele that causes organs to grow outside the body. Victoria's death was documented on "Run's House" so audiences could see how the family dealt with the tragedy. Joseph and Justine adopted a baby daughter, Miley, in 2007.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>After Simmons was ordained as a minister, his mentor, E. Bernard Jordan, gave him the "ProtÃ©gÃ© of the Year Award" in 2004. In 2007, the BMI Urban Awards named Joseph a BMI Icon. With Run-D.M.C., he earned a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016 and two Soul Train Awards in 1987, Best Rap Single for "Walk This Way" and Best Rap Album for "Raising Hell." The group also earned nominations from the American Music Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards, and they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2003, Simmons paid $1.6 million for a home in Saddle River, New Jersey. The 6-bedroom home, which served as the setting for "Run's House," was renovated by Justine and features a recording studio, home theater, and indoor basketball court. Joseph and Justine put the house on the market for $5.3 million in 2005, then re-listed it for $5.5 million in 2007.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6eyt3nRrqVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kaitlynn-beckworth-missing-has-she-been-found.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kaitlynn Beckworth Missing: Has She Been Found?</a>
