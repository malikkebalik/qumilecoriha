It is typically requested by a new landlord or property manager as part of the rental application process, in order to verify the tenant’s rental history and ensure that they are a reliable and responsible tenant. The letter is intended to provide insight into the tenant’s character and suitability as a tenant, based on the landlord’s experience renting to them.</p><h2><span id=What_should_be_included_in_a_tenant_recommendation_letter>What should be included in a tenant recommendation letter?</span></h2><p>A landlord letter of reference should include several key pieces of information that can help a potential new landlord or property manager assess the suitability of a tenant. Here are some of the things that should be included in a rental reference letter:</p><ul><li><strong>Introduction</strong>: The letter should begin with an introduction that includes the date, the name of the landlord or property manager, and the name of the tenant being referred.</li><li><strong>Rental history</strong>: The letter should include information about the tenant’s rental history, such as the length of their tenancy, the amount of rent they paid, and whether they paid on time. This information can help the new landlord or property manager assess the tenant’s financial responsibility.</li><li><strong>Behavior</strong>: The letter should provide details about the tenant’s behavior during their tenancy, such as whether they caused any damage to the property or were a good neighbor. This information can help the new landlord or property manager assess the tenant’s character and suitability as a tenant.</li><li><strong>Personal opinion</strong>: The letter may also include the landlord’s personal opinion of the tenant’s character and suitability as a tenant. This can be particularly helpful if the landlord has had a positive experience with the tenant and wishes to recommend them.</li><li><strong>Contact information</strong>: The letter should conclude with the landlord’s contact information, including their name, phone number, and email address. This will allow the new landlord or property manager to contact the landlord if they have any further questions.</li></ul><p>Overall, a landlord reference letter should be honest and provide a balanced view of the tenant’s rental history and behavior. It should also be well-written and professional in tone.</p><h3><span id=Sample_landlord_reference_letter>Sample landlord reference letter</span></h3><h4><span id=Example_of_a_reference_letter_from_a_landlord_where_there_were_no_problems>Example of a reference letter from a landlord where there were no problems:</span></h4><p><strong>Tenant Recommendation Letter</strong></p><p>Dear [Recipient’s Name],</p><p>I am writing this letter to serve as a reference for [Tenant’s Name], who was a tenant in one of my properties from [Start Date] to [End Date].
