Cole Hamels is probably best known for playing in the MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies. During his ten-year tenure with the team, he won the 2008 World Series and was named the tournament's MVP. Hamels later played for the Texas Rangers and Chicago Cubs, and briefly for the Atlanta Braves. At the peak of his career, Cole Hamels was one of the <a href=#>highest paid players in baseball</a> AND one of the <a href=#>highest paid athletes in the world</a> with a <a href=#>salary that routinely topped $22+ million</a>. In 2021 Cole signed a 1-year, $1 million deal with the Dodgers that also would have paid $200k per state. Unfortunately Cole injured himself&nbsp; just 12 days into the season. And since the contract was fully guaranteed, <a href=#>Cole earned $1 million essentially for no work</a>.</p><h2 id=career-earnings><strong>Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>During his career, Cole Hamels has earned $210 million in salary alone. He has earned tens of millions more from endorsements.</p><h2 id=early-life-high-school><strong>Early Life and High School</strong></h2><p>Cole Hamels was born on December 27, 1983 in San Diego, California as the eldest of three children. After attending Meadowbrook Middle School, he went to Rancho Bernardo High School, where he excelled both athletically and academically. Hamels drew the attention of scouts due to his impressive fastball, with his best coming in at 94 miles per hour.</p><h2 id=career-in-minors><strong>Career in the Minors</strong></h2><p>Hamels was drafted right out of high school in the 2002 MLB draft, chosen in the first round by the Philadelphia Phillies. He started his professional playing career the next year in the minors, pitching for the Class A Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League. Hamels was soon promoted to the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. His success garnered him the Paul Owens Award for being the best pitcher in the Phillies' minor league system. However, over the subsequent two seasons, Hamels pitched only occasionally due to a number of injuries, including a broken pitching hand caused by a bar fight. Upon his return, he played again for Clearwater before being promoted to the Class AA Reading Phillies. Partway through the 2006 season, Hamels was promoted to the Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208430 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cole-Hamels.jpg alt="Cole Hamels net worth" width=594 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-208430 class=wp-caption-text>Rich Schultz/Getty Images</p><h2 id=philadelphia-phillies-2006-2008><strong>Philadelphia Phillies, 2006-2008</strong></h2><p>In the spring of 2006, Hamels was called up to the majors to make his debut with the Philadelphia Phillies. He made his mark immediately, pitching five scoreless innings and allowing just one hit in his first game. Hamels ultimately finished his rookie season with a 9-8 record and 145 strikeouts. His 2007 season was an improvement in nearly every way, marked early on by his first major league complete game.

The Phillies ultimately advanced to the NLDS for the third consecutive season, and then to the NLCS, where they once again beat the Los Angeles Dodgers. In the World Series, the team fell to the New York Yankees. The Phillies made it to the NLDS for a fourth straight year in 2010 after finishing the regular season with the best record in the MLB.

He finished the season with career highs in wins, with 17, and strikeouts, with 216.
