Her parents, Don Flores and Carmen Milian, raised her in Waldorf, Maryland, along with her two younger sisters. Milian gets part of her stage name from her mother's maiden name; she changed her name in the hopes of landing a broader range of roles and opportunities. By as early as age nine, Milian was auditioning and landing roles for things like Wendy's commercials. When she was thirteen, her mother took her and her sisters and moved to Los Angeles, leaving her father in Maryland. Her parents divorced soon after.</p><p>In Los Angeles, Milian's dream was to become an actress. She managed to land some jobs, such as being a host for the series "Movie Surfers" on the Disney Channel, but after meeting producer Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins because they lived in the same apartment complex, she began spending more time recording music and meeting people in the recording industry.</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Milian's first ever professional music appearance was on the song "Between Me and You", on rapper <a href=# title="Ja Rule Net Worth">Ja Rule</a>'s album "Rule 3:36" (2000). The song peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 100. She went on to co-wrote songs for the likes of <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth">Jennifer Lopez</a> and PYT, and through her collaboration with Ja Rule, she landed a record deal with Def Soul Records. Her label took her to Sweden, where she recorded her self-titled debut album which was released in October 2001 in the UK. The album's American release had been postponed due to the September 11 attacks, and through several delays ultimately not released at all. She subsequently worked on various projects, including the theme song for the Disney Channel animated series "Kim Possible", as well as collaborations with Romeo and <a href=# title="Hilary Duff Net Worth">Hilary Duff</a>.
