Gene was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame (1969) and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1970), and he is the only person to receive stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in all five categories. Sadly, Autry passed away from lymphoma in October 1998 at the age of 91.</p><h2 id=business-career><strong>Business Career</strong></h2><p>Gene Autry successfully parlayed his fame into a business empire that ultimately included vast real estate holdings, a professional baseball team, hotels, a television studio, and several radio stations. Gene acquired the Anaheim Angels in 1960 and held the team until his death. He actually sold a portion to <a href=# title="Walt Disney Net Worth">Walt Disney</a> in 1995, then his widow sold the remainder of the team a year after his death. In 1982, Autry sold the KTLA television station for $245 million. At the time of his death, his worth was estimated at $320 million. That was enough to make him one of the 400 richest Americans.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Gene Autry was born Orvon Grover Autry on September 29, 1907, near Tioga, Texas. His parents, Elnora Ozment and Delbert Autry, moved the family to southern Oklahoma in the '20s, and Gene worked on Delbert's ranch as a teenager.

Gene began singing on the Tulsa radio station KVOO in 1928 as "Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy," and he signed with Columbia Records the following year. He spent four years working on the Chicago WLS-AM radio show "National Barn Dance," and in the early '30s, he recorded several "hillbilly"-style songs. Autry had his first hit with 1932's "That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine," a duet that he wrote and performed with Jimmy Long.
