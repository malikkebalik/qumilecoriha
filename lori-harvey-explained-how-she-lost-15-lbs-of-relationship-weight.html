In addition to thinking she‚Äôs very pretty, my impression of Lori has always been that she has a lovely figure. But I never got gym rat vibes or thought of her as super shredded. Turns out, that‚Äôs because she gained 15 pounds of relationship weight when she got serious with Michael B. Jordan. People noticed the changes, probably because of that dress, so Lori went on TikTok to talk about her exercise routine and diet.</p><p>Lori Harvey is opening up about her workout regimen and recent weight loss journey.</p><p>After attributing Pilates as the main reason for her toned Met Gala physique, the 25-year-old model had fans taking an interest in her fitness ‚Äî to both positive and negative reactions.</p><p>In a TikTok from the SKN founder this Friday, Harvey gave more details about her weight loss journey and exercise routine.</p><p>‚ÄúOkay so I just left my Pilates class,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand I see all the girls saying they‚Äôre signing up for Pilates now, love that for you guys.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúBut everybody‚Äôs been asking like what it is I specifically did to get my body to this point. So when Mike and I got together, I gained like 15 pounds of relationship weight and it was horrible, none of my clothes fit, it was just not OK,‚Äù she said, referring to her boyfriend of over a year, Michael B. Jordan.</p><p>Harvey continued, ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve been consistently doing Pilates for like the last year. I‚Äôve done it for a few years, but I‚Äôve been really consistent the last year. And when I was trying to drop weight, I was working out like five, six times a week, and I would even do, for the first month and a half, I would even do two-a-days.‚Äù</p><p>In terms of her diet during that time, Harvey said she wasn‚Äôt on a ‚Äúspecific eating regimen‚Äù but was on a strict calorie deficit. ‚ÄúI think I was consuming like 1,200 calories in a day, max. I was trying to do like meat and veggies and like minimal carbs.‚Äù</p><p>Other than Pilates and her diet, Harvey was also doing regular cardio exercises. ‚ÄúI had this sprint interval circuit that I would do so I would do pilates in the morning and then I would sometimes directly go to the gym and hop on the treadmill for 30 minutes or I also like to do a hike or I would run the stairs, just some type of cardio.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how you drop,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúPilates alone is not gonna make you lose weight, it‚Äôs just gonna give you long, lean muscles. So yeah, that‚Äôs how I did it.‚Äù</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>I‚Äôd happily gain 15 pounds if it was from staying in bed all day with Michael B. Jordan‚Ä¶ Relationship weight gain is real because you‚Äôre doing all those romantic dinners and brunches and lounging around (for normies it‚Äôs on couches, but I guess they do it on boats and stuff). She‚Äôs always looked great, but if she didn‚Äôt like being 15 pounds heavier that‚Äôs her choice. I looked up Lori‚Äôs height and she‚Äôs 5‚Äô3‚Ä≥ like me and 15 pounds really shows at this height. So I would want to lose the weight too, MBJ be dammed. I guess that‚Äôs what the off-theme dress was about: showing off all her hard work! Her abs and arms look amazing.</p><p>But it sounds like Lori lost the weight in a pretty healthful way? Unless I‚Äôm missing something, she didn‚Äôt put herself on some crazy timeline, she did it over the course of a year. And although she did count calories, she also did a lot of exercising with Pilates and cardio. I do agree with her technique and think I actually have similar workout vibes to her. I like to do things like Pilates and strength, but I never stray far from cardio because that‚Äôs my only real way to drop pounds. I like running and hiking and HIIT and stairs ‚Äî my best butt ever was when I lived in a 5th floor walkup, so I love stairs. Lori‚Äôs whole routine seems pretty realistic. My only quibble would be it works better for people who have a lot of time. Two-a-days or multiple types of exercise in the same day are tough for people who have a normal job.</p><a title=@loriharvey href=# rel=noopener>@loriharvey</a> Here‚Äôs the tea! üçµ <a title=pilates href=# rel=noopener>#pilates</a> <a title=fitness href=# rel=noopener>#fitness</a> <a title=workoutroutine href=# rel=noopener>#workoutroutine</a> <a title=bodygoal href=# rel=noopener>#bodygoal</a> <a title=fyp href=# rel=noopener>#fyp</a> <a title="‚ô¨ original sound - loriharvey" href=# rel=noopener>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì loriharvey</a><p>Photos credit: Instar, Avalon.red and via Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcG5nZYNye8uoqaKXmJa%2Ft7HYmJyxqJyWtq%2Bxw5ifqK%2BPqLWmq8uoqq2XYWqsra7SmKafl6KauaLAyKilrKCZpay4scign61n</p></div><div id=links><a href=./pierre-papillaud-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Pierre Papillaud Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
