Janu is best known for her work in the movie called Too Good to Be True.</p><p>Already a star, her fame rose to a new height after Angie married her husband,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> Jason Beghe</a>. So, apart from being the wife of a superstar, just what goes in the life of Angie? And how is she different from the glitz and glam of Hollywood? We will get into all of these right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/angie-0001.jpg><p>But first, some facts to kick start the article.</p><h2>Angie Janu: Quick Facts</h2><table class=facts><tbody><tr><th>Full Name:</th><td>Angeline Dawn Beghe</td></tr><tr><th>Stage Name:</th><td>Angie Janu</td></tr><tr><th>Birth Place:</th><td>The United States of America</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality:</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity:</th><td>North American</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color:</th><td>Hazel</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color:</th><td>Black</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status:</th><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><th>Spouse:</th><td>Jason Beghe (Ex)</td></tr><tr><th>Children:</th><td>2</td></tr><tr><th>Profession:</th><td>Model, Actress</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth:</th><td>$1.5 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Angie Janu: Age and Height</h2><p>The graceful Angie Janu has established herself as an actress in the entertainment world. Despite that, the actress has not disclosed any of her information to the general public.</p><p>‘Too Good to Be True’ is likely in her 50s as her birthday is still a matter of discussion. According to some sources, Janu was born in the mid-1960s.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Janu has got those pair of enchanting blonde eyes and frizzy black hair. She is also known for dying her hair. Along with it, she has got a gorgeous figure; however, the measurements are unknown. It also includes her height and weight.</p><p>But some sources claim Agnes to be around 5 feet 7 inches(170 cm) tall, judging by her pictures online.</p><h2>Early Life and Education</h2><p>Too Good to Be True actress Angie Janu was born somewhere in the city of the United States of America. American by nationality, she belongs to North American ethnicity.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holly Anna Ramsay Age, Height, Twin, Father, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Likewise, Janu’s full name is Angeline Dawn Beghe. Sadly, there is little to no information about her parents and siblings.</p><p>The same is the case with her educational background. No academic details have been revealed to the public, making it harder for us to determine her qualifications.</p><h2>Professional Career: Chicago Pd</h2><p>Unlike her husband, Jason, Janu did not have what we call a successful career. Initially, Angie worked as a model and entered the glamorous world of Hollywood. The model was successful in her job until she decided to take part in acting as well.</p><p>Angie started her on-screen job from commercials before her big shot in 1997. In fact, the model turned actress got her big break from the movie ‘Too Good to Be True,‘ which was a huge success.</p><p>However, the success of the movie did no good for Janu at all. Neither did it bring more projects towards her way, nor it helped Angie establish herself as an actress. With that being said, the actress no longer appeared in any TV series or movie.</p><p>It would be safe to say that Angie’s career in acting stopped right there without any notice. She came and went away just like that.</p><h2>Angie Janu and Jason Beghe</h2><p>It is no secret that Angie is someone who failed after trying to make it in the movie industry. Sadly, the former actress only came to the limelight after marrying her husband, Jason Beghe.</p><p>For those who don’t know, Jason is a famous American actor who has been active in the industry since 1985. Contrary to Janu, Beghe is a big deal in the movie industry. It is not known when and where the couple first time. But regardless of it, the duo managed to fall in love with each other.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Berlin Age, Height, CNN, Wife, Kids, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Rumors have it that the duo dated for a couple of years before exchanging the vows. Soon in February 2000, the lovely duo tied the knot in an intimate wedding ceremony. Many of their friends and families attended their beautiful wedding.</p><p>Likewise, from their union, the couple has two beautiful children<strong>, Bix Beghe</strong> and<strong> Bo Beghe,</strong> who are both 14 and 11 years old, respectively. Unfortunately, their whereabouts and present conditions are unknown as of now. The family of four was living a blissful life that no one doubted they would ever fall apart.</p><h2>Angie and Jason Are Getting A Divorce?</h2><p>Unlike her career in the entertainment industry, Angie’s love was discussed and discussed in the media. It was because of her media that she came into the spotlight. This time, the couple’s relationship was discussed in the press; however, this time, it was for the wrong reasons. In late 2017, their sour turned relationship caught many off-guard.</p><p>Similarly, in December 2017, Beghe filed for divorce from his wife of 17 years. The duo has been living apart since 2015, right when Jason publicly criticized Scientology. Formerly, the actor was a part of the church of Scientology and participated in activities promoting it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/angie-0002.jpg><p>Moreover, Beghe started a documentary on HBO, where he explained about Scientology. But he left the group in 2017 and publicly criticized it later on. He explained,</p><h3>“Scientology delivers what it promised under the guise of tearing away falsity, neuroses, psychoses. It creates a brainwashed, robotic version of you. It’s a ‘Matrix’ of you, so you’re communicating with people all the time using Scientology.”</h3><p>Moreover, during this time, his relationship with other cast members also turned sour. Because of his hurtful behavior, actress <strong>Sophia Bush</strong> left the show ‘Chicago Pd,’ and he began going to anger management coach.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income</h2><p>As of 2020, the former actress/model has an estimated net worth of <strong>$1.5 million</strong>. ‘Too Good to Be True’ actress made most of her income from her somewhat average career as an actress and model.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doug Hitchner Age, Height, Career, Hallie Jackson, Net Worth >></a></h4><p>Meanwhile, her former husband, Beghe, has an impressive net value of <strong>$9 million.</strong> Beghe made most of his fortune from his successful career as an actor in Hollywood. Some of his renowned movies include Compromising Positions, Jimmy Hollywood, The X-Files, Monkey Shines, The Next Three Days, Downtown, and many others.</p><h2>Angie Janu: Divorce and Demands</h2><p>After the news broke out of the two breaking up, many media flocked to get the story out of it. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">E! News</a>, Jason has demanded the joint and physical custody of the couple’s children. Since their split, the two children have been living with their mother, Agnes.</p><p>Added to that, the former husband is happy to pay for his spousal support, but only if he gets properties in return. Not to mention, this also includes his Near Wes Side, Chicago condo. On July 15, 2019, the actor bought the 6,200 square-foot, four-bedroom home for a whopping <strong>$1.63 million.</strong></p><p>To clarify, Beghe wants the Oklahoma Property and inherited mineral rights from both Oklahoma and Texas. Moreover, he also demanded the sale of another property in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Similarly, Angie and Jason will both fight for the family Malibu home and other assets. And to top it off, the actor has demanded that the couple share the divorce lawyer fees.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>To this date, the actress/former wife of Jason Beghe is not active in any social media accounts.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wKeeop1dn66vwYyboKhlkZyybq7Iq6uhnJGueqS0yJyYoKddpbFutNSsmZqmlGKxqsLOq5qeZZmjwLWtxquYpmc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fans-favorite-stanley-line-about-pretzel-day-wasn-t-the-original-line-in-the-script.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fans' Favorite Stanley Line About Pretzel Day Wasn't the Original Line in the Script</a>
